# CCValidation

The algorithm performs performs operations on each digit in the credit card number, then adds the modified digits together. If that number is divisble by 10 in the end (ie. 70), then the credit card number is valid. Note: This is just the first step of verification, you would then need to check the expiry date and CVC, if they are valid, the you would communicate with the bank servers and see if it is actually in the system
